In this exercise, we are going to replicate the SPSS MIXED analysis in R. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(rmdformats)
library(prettydoc)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(tint)
library(tufte)
```

Load libraries
```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(haven)
library(dplyr)
library(nlme)
```

Load SPSS data file
```{r}
dyad_df <- read_sav("sample data_two_level.sav")
```

Let's first run this analysis using linear regression (ignoring nonindependence).
```{r}
lm_mod <- lm(awish ~ sloppy_roommateC + first_similarNC + genderN,
                  data = dyad_df)

summary(lm_mod)
```
**MINI-CHALLENGE**: *How would you interpret the linear model results?*

--------

### Here is the original SPSS code

    MIXED
    awish  WITH sloppy_roommateC first_similarNC genderN
     /FIXED = sloppy_roommateC first_similarNC genderN
    /PRINT = SOLUTION TESTCOV
    /Repeated day | SUBJECT(participant_ID) COVTYPE(CSH).
    

### Let's replicate it in R  


#### How are we accounting for within-person effects?


When you use the /REPEATED part in the MIXED command, you're telling SPSS, "Hey, my data has measurements that are related to each other (like several measurements from the same person)."The COVTYPE(CSH) option is SPSS's way of saying, "Not only are these measurements related, but they also might have different levels of variability."

In the gls model, Participant_ID can be included as part of a correlation structure, but not as a random effect.
The correlation argument in gls (e.g., corCompSymm(form = ~ 1 | Participant_ID)) specifies a correlation structure for the residuals. This means that observations (e.g., awish) from the same participant are assumed to be correlated. We also add the "weights" line to tell R that each day should have its own variability.

```{r}
# optional
ctrl <- lmeControl(msMaxIter=10000,
                   MaxIter=100000,
                   msMaxEval=10000,
                   returnObject=TRUE,
                   niterEM=10000,
                   nlmStepMax=1000)

# Treating day as distinguishing factor
model_dist <- gls(awish ~ sloppy_roommateC + first_similarNC + genderN, 
                  data = dyad_df, 
                  method = "REML", 
                  na.action=na.exclude,
                  correlation = corCompSymm(form = ~ 1 | Participant_ID), 
                  weights = varIdent(form = ~1 | day))


anova(model_dist, type = "marginal")
model_parameters(model_dist, df_method = "sattherwaite")
```

### Now, let's compare these results to SPSS

#### SPSS: Omnibus Test

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('pp1_omnibus.png')
```

#### R: Omnibus Test

```{r}
anova(model_dist, type = "marginal")
```

#### SPSS: Fixed Effects

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('pp1_fixedeffects.png')
```

#### R: Fixed Effects

```{r}
# View fixed effects
options(scipen=999) # optional: don't put p-values in scientific notation
as.data.frame(summary(model_dist)$tTable)
```

Confidence intervals

```{r}
intervals(model_dist)
```

#### SPSS: Covariance Parameters

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('pp1_covariance.png')
```

#### R: Covariance Parameters

```{r}
getVarCov(model_dist)
```

### What if we want to add interactions?

```{r}
# Treating day as distinguishing factor
model_dist_int <- gls(awish ~ sloppy_roommateC + first_similarNC + genderN + dayR +
                      dayR:sloppy_roommateC + dayR:first_similarNC + dayR:genderN, # specify interactions with :
                  data = dyad_df, # specify dataframe
                  method = "REML", 
                  na.action=na.exclude, # ignore NA values
                  control = ctrl, # reference ctrl we created
                  correlation = corCompSymm(form = ~ 1 | Participant_ID), # tells R this is within-person
                  weights = varIdent(form = ~1 | day)) # gives each 'day' its own variance

# print all results
summary(model_dist_int)
```

```{r}
# Treating day as distinguishing factor
model_dist_int <- lme(awish ~ sloppy_roommateC + 
                        first_similarNC + 
                        genderN + 
                        dayR +
                        dayR:sloppy_roommateC + 
                        dayR:first_similarNC + 
                        dayR:genderN, # specify interactions with :
                  data = dyad_df, # specify dataframe
                  method = "REML", 
                  random = ~ 1 | Participant_ID,
                  na.action=na.exclude, # ignore NA values
                  control = ctrl) # reference ctrl we created
                #  correlation = corCompSymm(form = ~ 1 | Participant_ID), # tells R this is within-person
              #    weights = varIdent(form = ~1 | day)) # gives each 'day' its own variance

summary(model_dist_int)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('pp1_fixed_interactions.png')
```

# how to restructure wide to long (person period)
```{r}

df <- read.csv("wide sample data_two_level.csv")

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

df1 <- df %>%
  select(-first_similarNC_.1) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(awish_.1, awish_1, sloppy_roommateC_.1, sloppy_roommateC_1),
    names_to = c(".value", "day"),
    names_pattern = "(.*)_(.*)",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  mutate(day1 = ifelse(day == ".1", 1, 2)) %>% 
  select(-day)

```
